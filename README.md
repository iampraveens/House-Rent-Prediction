## Overview
The Rental Property Price Prediction project harnesses machine learning to estimate rental property prices accurately. It features meticulous data processing methods and implements a variety of regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, ElasticNet, XGBoost, and a GridSearchCV-based selection. A user-friendly Streamlit web app allows users to input property details and promptly receive real-time price predictions.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset (`house_rent.csv`) used for training and predictions.
- `pipelines/`: Includes ZenML pipelines for data cleaning, model training, and evaluation.
- `steps/`: Custom Python scripts for data loading, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code files, including data cleaning strategies, model development, and utilities.
- `saved_models/`: Stores trained machine learning models.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for model saving and loading.
- `app.py`: Streamlit-based web application for predicting car prices.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.
- `Dockerfile`: Docker configuration for containerizing the web app.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iampraveens/House-Rent-Prediction.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Training the Model

```bash
python ./steps/run_pipeline.py
```
- This command will execute the data cleaning, model training, and evaluation process

## Save the Model

```bash
python ./steps/save_model.py
```

## Prediction

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Dockerized Web App
You can also deploy the Rental Property Price Prediction web application using Docker. Build the Docker image and run the container:
```bash
docker build -t your_docker_username/rental-property-price-prediction-app .
```
- To build a docker image.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 your_docker_username/rental-property-price-prediction-app
```
- To run as a container.

Access the web app at `http://localhost:8501` or `your_ip_address:8501` in your web browser.
Else if you want to access my pre-built container, here is the code below to pull from docker hub(Public).
```bash
docker pull iampraveens/rent-price-app:latest
```
